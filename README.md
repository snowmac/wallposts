Setup instructions: 

1. Ensure that Ruby 2.2.3 is installed if not I recommend using rbenv to install that. 

2. bundle install to get the gems installed

3. bundle exec rspec to run specs

4. start the server by running "rails s" and go to http://localhost:3000 to see the site

Debugging tips: We rely on a CDN for the Angular library, so ensure you have internet access.
